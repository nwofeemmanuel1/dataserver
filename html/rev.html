        <p>I cant find words to describe how good this browser extension is when it comes to detecting fraudulent websites and spams.
          not to point out the fact that it's a free software. As a developer, i would have hade it a premium extension...Lol kudos to you guys.

        <p>Being able to access to hidden details every website i visit is great, because this extension gives a historical representation of what the website has done in the past and helps me know whether it's real or fake.</p>
